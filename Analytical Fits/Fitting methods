Findfit Function in Mathematica:

First Method: Principal component analysis (PCA) : Replacing all the features (parameters) with lesser number of new features.
Second Method: Ordinary Least Square (OLS) : Finding least square fit for linear or nonlinear case.
Third Method: Gradient Descent : Iterative Methods to minimize the error using different methods (Eg. Newton-Raphson Method)


Second Approach
Regularization methods: LASSO or Ridge regression
